#### Are you a hardware/software manufacturer considering using SOUL in a future product?

If so, fantastic! (And you're not alone!) 

To encourage this, we've made the license and EULA permissive enough to allow anyone to freely start building and shipping products that incorporate the SOUL JIT engine.

If you're a larger company and are considering making a long-term/expensive commitment to SOUL as a technology, you may want a more formal support/licensing agreement with us to keep you more closely involved with its future development. If so, please get in touch with us!
